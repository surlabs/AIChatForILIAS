# AI Chat Repository Object Plugin for ILIAS 9

Welcome to the official repository for AI Chat Repository Object Plugin for ILIAS
This Open Source ILIAS Plugin is created and maintained by [SURLABS](https://www.surlabs.com)

## What is AI Chat for ILIAS?

This plugin enhances ILIAS platforms by enabling seamless integration with both online Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT series, and locally-installed models such as LLaMA. It allows for real-time interaction with these advanced AI models directly within the learning environment, enabling dynamic, AI-driven text generation and assistance. The plugin supports customizable configurations to connect to various API endpoints or local installations, ensuring flexibility and control. This integration not only enriches educational content but also provides learners and educators with powerful tools for automated question-answering, content summarization, and personalized learning experiences.

## Which LLMs are currently supported?

- [OpenAI](https://openai.com) GPT-4o

## Can I use different API-keys for different Objects?
